sentimentAnalysisTwitter
========================

Android app for sentimental analysis. App was developed during hackathon( 1 day ), so not optimized

In this app, I fetched tweets from the user and found the sentimets. I classified tweets into sad, happy and neutral mood.

I also fetched location and address of the tweet.

Also compared different users with sentiments and retweet count
